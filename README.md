# Road_Sign_Classification



### Abstract:


The goal of this project is to use Deep Learning tools such as CNN to build a multi-class classification model to classify road traffic signs. Traffic sign recognition is the process of identifying which class the sign belongs to such as stop signs, traffic lights or speeding signs. Building a reliable traffic sign recognition system plays a critical role in developing and operating autonomous vehicles.

### Design:


The first step for a first-time driver’s license applicant is to pass the driving written test which contains identifying and understanding road signs. To keep our cities safe, all auto operators must recognize and abide by the rules on the road. With the growth of autonomous devices living with us, it is important for these autonomous devices to understand and communicate with humans.  

Therefore, a deep learning model was built to classify the class a road sign belongs to such as speed limits, stop signs, turn right or left, etc… This model will help with the interaction of machines and humans to produce a productive society.
